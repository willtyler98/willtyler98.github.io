# willtyler98.github.io

This is my personal website. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.

## Organization

The static web files generated by Angular are pushed to the **master** branch using [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages), a convienient tool that helps developers build their Github Pages with Angular. In order to commit my build to **master**, I use `ngh --branch="master" --dir=dist/willtyler98/`.

The **angular** branch contains the actual Angular CLI project and source files.
